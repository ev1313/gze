Bugfixes:
- Scenario properties error on Landscape.txt + Custom Materials
- Network game: maxfileload size much higher and show appropriate error if too low
- Please play sounds centered to the active clonk, not centered to the current screen. It makes sounds awkardly silent when playing e.g. in big resolutions and at the edge of the screen

Features:
- 100 Eur to the one who builds a clonk frontend like CE has (player mode / developer mode) but for CR, including lobby functionality. No joke!
- Load Script files inside System.c4g/Subfolder - would be extremly useful to help organise code (e.g. one file for each function)

- pObj->localvariable = 123;
- Ways to hook into various engine created content (e.g. Scenario Disasters Section, Vegetation placement, etc.)


- System.c4g cleanup - organize script code by category (like in the documentation)
- More appropriate Splash sound for lava pls (when objects fall in lava) :-)

- How about not using index 0 as materialindex? It makes many things way more complicated (0 should be "any" material in function parameters)
- void datatype for declaring no return values for funcs

- animated liquids plz! (example: animation abilities in minecraft resources packs)

- http sockets plz! :D

- zomg, why only .wav for Sound()?

- We got SetSkyAdjust() and SetMatAdjust() but no SetObjAdjust() :(

- Allow ingame transitions for Skies (Awesome for Day/Night sky, Weather dependent Sky)

to document:

- Scenario.txt  Min,Max,Random Values (e.g. landscape width)
- C4Id()
- datentyp "any" (e.g. InArray(any elem, array myArray))
