Improves ambient sounds in clonk.


- All ambient sounds play from one enviroment object (not 3 like in CR)
- Ambient sounds play for each player individually
- Ambient sounds play only if the player is in the right enviroment. So you will not hear birds deep underground etc. 

- This enviroment object is freely configurable! With the function AddAmbient() and RemoveAmbient() you can build your very own ambient sounds for your scenario.
